Clustering and Failover features as described below are not yet implemented in MSS for JBoss AS7. This guide will be updated when the feature becomes available.
</p></div><p> High Availability </p><p>
Is a term used to describe software and hardware based strategies that are implemented to ensure optimal performance and continuous system operation in case of failure. High availability encompasses, clustering, failover and load balancing
</p><p>  Clustering </p><p>
Is a technique used to ensure continuous service availability by having two or more servers communicate with each other and share configuration and application data (replication) on  fixed, predetermined intervals. This produces two or more application servers with identical setup. There is often a primary server within a clustered cloud from which data is replicated to the secondary. The application servers within a clustered environment will use what is called a heartbeat to ensure that all servers within are alive and functioning. In the case of failure, another server (secondary) will take over the task of responding to client's requests without impacting user experience. In some clustered ecosystem, load balancing is used as explained below.

</p><p> Load Balancing</p><p>
This is ultimately about performance. All request from clients  are evenly distributed by the (load balancer) to multiple application servers that are running similar configurations.This type of setup often includes fault tolerance or failover. When one of the nodes, application server instance is not available, all traffic will be directed to the remaining servers. This ensures continuity albeit performance can degrade. Load balancing allows a single point of entry for multiple clients.
</p><p> Failover </p><p>
Failover is a way to provide continuous service to clients connecting to an application server in case of system, software or hardware failure. Connections to an unresponsive server is directed (failed over) to a backup server. This is often done within the scope of a clustered configuration aided by a load balancer.
</p><p>
It is important to note that clustering is also a way to provide failover and enhance server performance. The same can be said of load balancing. The idea behind all the above mentioned techniques is to provide high availability to connecting clients connecting to applications running on Mobicents. In a nutshell, high availability englobes all the above mentioned techniques.

            cookie (the jvmRoute part) of any HTTP request that arrives at 
          the wrong node. The application server will do so with a specially composed HTTP redirect response or with a HTML refresh hint. As a backup strategy, if the request is bound to seek
           non-existing node forever and it will let the request be served by a new node. This avoids having a client stuck reloading the same page over and over.</p><p>One problem with this flag is that if you have two or more SIP sessions associated with the same application session and the load balancer has decided to send SIP requests
           to different nodes, which might happend if you use Call-ID based affinity, then the application server will have to change the jvmRoute very often for every SIP request resulting
            in significant overhead. It is generally not adviced to enable this flag if you have more than 1 SIP session per application session and the means to guarantee all SIP sessions
            from the application session will land on the same node.</p><p>This is an example how to enable the option. It is disabled by default.</p><pre xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" xmlns:rf="java:org.jboss.highlight.XhtmlRendererFactory" class="">&lt;Connector port="5080"

For both HTTP and SIP messages, there is a configurable affinity key, which is evaluated and hashed against each unassigned request. All requests with the same hash value will always be routed to the same application server node. For example, the SIP affinity key could be the callee user name and the HTTP affinity key could the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">appsession</span>”</span> HTTP GET parameter of the request.

IP load-balancing is often used when the other load-balancers' capacity is exceeded and can not scale further without hardware upgrades.</p><p>Routing decisions are made  based on OSI Layer 2, 3 or 4 data. This type of load balancer only examines low-level TCP, UDP or ethernet packet structures including MAC addresses, IP addresses, ports, and protocol types (TCP or UDP or other). </p><p>An IP  load balancer never reads the payload of the TCP/IP packets and therefore never parses SIP or HTTP (or any protocol above OSI Layer 4).  Because an IP load balancing device is not SIP or HTTP aware in any way, it is much more performant than <code class="literal">mod_jk</code> or the MSS SIP load-balancer.

</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="d0e4383"/>5.2.2.2. Technical overview</h4></div></div></div><p>In its simplest form, the IP load-balancer usually "owns" the public-facing IP address (known as a VIP).   The traffic is routed to actual servers in it's private network similar to NAT. It is also possible to not change the IP address and just work on the MAC address by assuming that all actual  servers are configured to accept packets for the VIP address. The features offered by the IP load balancer depend largely on the vendor. </p><p>Some examples of  Linux-based  software load balancers include <a class="ulink" href="http://www.redhat.com/cluster_suite/">Red Hat Cluster Suite (RHCS)</a> and <a class="ulink" href="http://www.linuxvirtualserver.org/">Linux Virtual Server (LVS)</a>. There are many hardware vendors as well.</p><p>One main drawback relating to  IP load balancers is that they can not make routing decisions based on SIP messages and (with some exceptions) they can not work cooperatively with HTTP or other load balancers.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="d0e4400"/>5.2.2.3. Configuring MSS Cluster for pure IP Load Balancing</h4></div></div></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" xmlns:rf="java:org.jboss.highlight.XhtmlRendererFactory" class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h2>Warning</h2><p>Pure IP load balancing is not a recommented option. It is advised to use a distributed load balancer instead. Proper operation with pure IP load balancing depends on the ability of the IP load balancer to establish request affinity based on IP addresses and ports.</p></div><p>First you need to remove the SIP load balancers from any configuration in MSS. In particular the <code class="literal">org.mobicents.ha.javax.sip.BALANCERS</code> 
      attribute in <code class="filename">mss-sip-stack.properties</code>. You should remove the balancers attribute from the Service tag of 
      jboss.web service. This simply removes the default load balancer from the system and the traffic bypasses the SIP load-balancer. Next you must configure
       MSS to put the IP load balancer IP address in the <code class="literal">Via</code>, <code class="literal">Contact</code> and other system headers where 
       the IP address of the server machine is required. This will ensure that any responses or subsequent SIP requests follow the same path, but always hit 
       the load balancer instead of particular cluster node that may fail.  To specify the IP load balancer address in MSS your should edit
        this file on Tomcat <code class="filename">CATALINA_HOME/conf/server.xml</code> and specify <code class="literal">staticServerAddress</code> such as: </p><pre xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" xmlns:rf="java:org.jboss.highlight.XhtmlRendererFactory" class="">&lt;Connector port="5080"

The Load Balancer then parses, alters, and forwards those messages to an available node in the cluster. If the message was sent as a part of an existing SIP session, it will be forwarded to the cluster node which processed that User Agent's original transaction request.
    </p><p>The SIP Server that receives the message acts upon it and sends a response back to the SIP Load Balancer. The SIP Load Balancer reparses, alters and forwards the message back to the original User Agent. This entire proxying and provisioning process is carried out independent of the User Agent, which is only concerned with the SIP service or application it is using.
    </p><p>By using the Load Balancer, SIP traffic is balanced across a pool of available SIP Servers, increasing the overall throughput of the SIP service or application running on either individual nodes of the cluster. In the case of a MSS server with <code class="literal">&lt;/distributed&gt;</code> capabilities, load balancing advantages are applied across the entire cluster.
    </p><p>The SIP Load Balancer is also able to failover requests mid-call from unavailable nodes to available ones, thus increasing the reliability of the SIP service or application. The Load Balancer increases throughput and reliability by dynamically provisioning SIP service requests and responses across responsive nodes in a cluster. This enables SIP applications to meet the real-time demand for SIP services.
    </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="d0e4463"/>5.2.4. HTTP Load Balancing Basics</h3></div></div></div><p>In addition to the SIP load balancing, there are several options for coordinated or cooperative load balancing with other protocols such as HTTP.
    </p><p>Typically, a JBoss Application Server will use apache HTTP server with mod_jk, mod_proxy, mod_cluster or similar extension installed as an HTTP load balancer. This apache-based load balancer will parse incoming HTTP requests and will look for the session ID of those requests in order to ensure all requests from the same session arrive at the same application server.
    </p><p>By default, this is done by examining the <code class="literal">jsessionid</code> HTTP cookie or GET parameter and looking for the <code class="literal">jvmRoute</code> assigned to the session. The typical <code class="literal">jsessionid</code> value is of the form <code class="literal">&lt;sessionId&gt;.&lt;jvmRoute&gt;</code>. The very first request for each new HTTP session does not have a session ID assigned; the apache routes the request to a random application server node.
    </p><p>When the node responds it assigns a session ID and <code class="literal">jvmRoute</code> to the response of the request in a HTTP cookie. This response goes back to the client through apache, which keeps track of which node owns each <code class="literal">jvmRoute</code>. Once the very first request is served this way, the subsequent requests from this session will carry the assigned cookie, and the apache load balancer will always route the requests to the node, which advertised itself as the <code class="literal">jvmRoute</code> owner.
    </p><p>Instead of using apache, an integrated HTTP Load Balancer is also available. The SIP Load Balancer has a HTTP port where you can direct all incoming HTTP requests. The integrated HTTP load balancer behaves exactly like apache by default, but this behavior is extensible and can be overridden completely with the pluggable balancer algorithms. The integrated HTTP load balancer is much easier to configure and generally requires no effort, because it reuses most SIP settings and assumes reasonable default values.
    </p><p>Unlike the native apache, the integrated HTTP Load Balancer is written completely in Java, thus a performance penalty should be expected when using it. However, the integrated HTTP Balancer has an advantage when related SIP and HTTP requests must stick to the same node.

By default there are three built-in algorithms. Only one algorithm is active at any time and it is specified with the <code class="literal">algorithmClass</code> property in the configuration file.</p><p>It is up to the algorithm how and whether to support distributed architecture or how to store the information needed for session affinity. The algorithms will be called for every SIP and HTTP request and other significant events to make more informed decisions.
